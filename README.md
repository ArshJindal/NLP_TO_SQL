# NLP_TO_SQL

**Overview**
This project aims to bridge the gap between natural language queries and structured data, leveraging the power of Google Gemini, an AI model, to interpret user queries and generate SQL code for retrieving information from structured data.

Structured data, typically organized in the form of tables, often require specific query languages like SQL for accessing information. However, querying data using SQL may pose challenges for users unfamiliar with its syntax or those more comfortable with natural language.

To address this challenge, this project utilizes Google Gemini's natural language processing capabilities to translate user queries into SQL code. By doing so, it simplifies the process of extracting information from structured data, making it more accessible to a wider range of users.

**Functionality**
The core functionality of this project includes:

Interpretation of natural language queries: Google Gemini processes user-provided natural language queries.
Generation of SQL code: Based on the interpreted query, the project generates SQL code tailored to retrieve relevant information from structured data.
Execution of SQL queries: The generated SQL code is executed using SQL functions, enabling seamless retrieval of data.
**Dependencies**
Google Gemini: The project relies on Google Gemini as the AI model for interpreting natural language queries.
SQL Database: Structured data is assumed to be stored in a SQL database accessible via SQL queries.

**Usage**
To use the project, follow these steps:

Input a natural language query.
Google Gemini interprets the query and generates corresponding SQL code.
Execute the generated SQL code to retrieve information from the structured data.


Future Improvements
Integration with additional AI models for improved natural language understanding.
Support for more complex queries and diverse data structures.
Enhanced error handling and feedback mechanisms for users.
